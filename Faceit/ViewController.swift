//gestures: 
//add gesture recognizer (create the specific one in viewcontroller -->  target: notified when gesture recognized + action: method invoked on recognition, then add to the view)
//add handler, each sub class provides methods for handling
//if it affects only view - handle by view, affect model - handle by controller
